  üïµÔ∏è CONDUCT FORENSIC COLUMN-BY-COLUMN INVESTIGATION:

  üìä EVIDENCE TO ANALYZE:
  - Dataset: ${file_name}
  - Project Context: ${project_summary}
  - Codebase Context: ${code_summary}

  üß† SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE FROM CODEBASE:
  ${semantic_column_knowledge}

  üìã COLUMN DATA TO INVESTIGATE:
  ${columns_data}

  üîç FORENSIC INVESTIGATION - For EACH column:
  
  1. **NAME ANALYSIS**: Is this column name vague, cryptic, or misleading?
  2. **SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE**: Check if we have extracted definitions from Pydantic models or code comments
  3. **HIDDEN MEANING**: Based on codebase context, what business logic produces these values?
  4. **CROSS-REFERENCE**: Map suspicious names to potential code locations.
  5. **PATTERN DETECTION**: Are there magic numbers, unusual ranges, or suspicious patterns?

  üéØ EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:
  - Maximum response: 1200 characters total
  - Use precise technical terminology
  - Focus on highest-value insights

  üîç REQUIRED ANALYSIS FORMAT:
  1. **DOMAIN ANALYSIS**: Overall business domain and context of this dataset
  2. **DATA QUALITY**: Overall structural quality assessment
  3. **COLUMN INTERPRETATIONS**: For each column, provide nested analysis
  4. **BUSINESS VALUE**: How this data provides business insights

  ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL Output Format Rules:
  - Output must be **valid JSON only** matching DataAIEnrichment schema
  - column_interpretations must contain nested ai_enrichment objects
  - derived_from: Must be a list ["relation1", "relation2"] or null
  - Never include markdown or prose
  - Focus on business logic and data relationships

  üìã Required Output Structure (DataAIEnrichment format):
  {
    "domain_analysis": "Overall domain this dataset represents and business context",
    "data_quality_assessment": "Overall assessment of data structure and quality",
    "column_interpretations": {
      "column_name": {
        "ai_enrichment": {
          "semantic_meaning": "What this column represents",
          "domain_context": "Business domain context", 
          "usage_guidance": "How to use this column",
          "data_quality_assessment": "Quality notes",
          "derived_from": ["related_col1", "related_col2"]
        }
      }
    },
    "business_value_assessment": "How this data provides business value and insights"
  }

  üìã Return optimized JSON in DataAIEnrichment format with proper nested structure.
