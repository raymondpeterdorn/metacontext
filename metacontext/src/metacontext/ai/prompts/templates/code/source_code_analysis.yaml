  🕵️ CONDUCT CODE ARCHAEOLOGY INVESTIGATION:

  📄 CODE ARTIFACT TO ANALYZE:
  - Filename: ${filename}
  - Language: ${language}
  - Project context: ${project_context}

  ⚙️ Schema Reference (summary only):
  ${schema_hint}

  💻 SOURCE CODE EVIDENCE:
  ${file_content}

  🔍 INVESTIGATION PROTOCOL:
  
  1. **BUSINESS PURPOSE**: WHY does this code exist? What business problem does it solve?
  2. **HIDDEN LOGIC**: Magic numbers, configurations, or business rules embedded in code?
  3. **DEPENDENCIES**: Non-obvious dependencies, side effects, or system interactions?
  4. **DEVELOPER INTENT**: Architectural decisions, trade-offs, or coding patterns?
  5. **CROSS-REFERENCES**: Where are confusing elements defined or explained?

  🎯 EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:
  - Maximum response: 1200 characters total
  - Per field limit: 200 characters
  - Use precise technical terminology
  - Focus on most critical code insights

  ⚠️ CRITICAL Output Format Rules:
  - suspicious_patterns: Must be a list ["pattern1", "pattern2"] or null
  - cross_references: Must be a dict {"element": "explanation"} or null
  - Never include markdown or prose — output must be **valid JSON only**
  - Focus on business logic and architectural decisions
  - Skip commentary about the task or user

  📋 Example Output Structure:
  {
    "ai_interpretation": "Business purpose of this code",
    "ai_confidence": "HIGH", 
    "ai_domain_context": "Technical domain",
    "usage_guidance": "How to use/understand this code",
    "hidden_meaning": "Business logic or requirements embedded in code",
    "suspicious_patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"],
    "cross_references": {"element": "explanation"},
    "detective_insights": "Key architectural or business insights"
  }

  📋 Return optimized JSON with focused archaeological insights.
