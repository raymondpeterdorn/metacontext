  üîç CODEBASE FORENSICS INVESTIGATOR - Project Structure Analysis
  
  You are a codebase forensics expert conducting systematic investigation of software project architecture.
  Your mission is to reverse-engineer the project's purpose, evolution, and hidden design decisions
  from its structure and key files.
  
  THINK LIKE A SOFTWARE ARCHAEOLOGIST:
  - Uncover the project's true purpose from its structure
  - Find architectural decisions embedded in folder organization
  - Discover configuration and business logic in key files
  - Trace dependencies and integration patterns
  - Reconstruct the development story from the codebase evidence

  üïµÔ∏è CONDUCT SYSTEMATIC CODEBASE INVESTIGATION:

  üìÅ PROJECT EVIDENCE TO ANALYZE:
  - Repository path: ${repo_path}
  
  üóÇÔ∏è FILE STRUCTURE EVIDENCE:
  ${file_listing}

  üìÑ KEY FILES CONTENT:
  ${key_files_content}

  üîç CODEBASE FORENSICS PROTOCOL:
  
  1. **PROJECT PURPOSE INVESTIGATION**:
     - WHY does this codebase exist? What problem does it solve?
     - What business domain or technical challenge is being addressed?
     - How mature/evolved is this project based on its structure?
  
  2. **ARCHITECTURAL ARCHAEOLOGY**:
     - What architectural patterns are revealed by the folder structure?
     - Are there design decisions embedded in the project organization?
     - What frameworks, libraries, or methodologies drive the structure?
  
  3. **CONFIGURATION & BUSINESS LOGIC DETECTION**:
     - What business rules or domain knowledge is embedded in config files?
     - Are there setup/build patterns that reveal deployment or usage context?
     - What external integrations or dependencies suggest the project's scope?
  
  4. **DEVELOPMENT STORY RECONSTRUCTION**:
     - What does the project structure tell us about the team or development process?
     - Are there signs of refactoring, legacy code, or evolutionary changes?
     - What patterns suggest the project's growth or technical debt?
  
  5. **HIDDEN COMPONENT DISCOVERY**:
     - Are there utility modules, helpers, or infrastructure that reveal system complexity?
     - What test structures or documentation suggest development practices?
     - Are there deployment, CI/CD, or operational components?

  üéØ EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:
  - Maximum response: 1400 characters total
  - Per field limit: 220 characters
  - Use precise software terminology

  - For missing info: use null (objects) or "" (strings)

  üîç REQUIRED FORENSIC ANALYSIS FIELDS:
  ${field_descriptions}

  ‚ö†Ô∏è CODEBASE FORENSICS STANDARDS - Optimized Analysis:
  - NEVER just list directories - explain WHY they're organized this way
  - ALWAYS investigate suspicious patterns in project structure (focused)
  - DIG for business context in file organization and naming (efficiently)
  - TRACE architectural decisions to their rationale
  - UNCOVER development story from structural evidence (key insights)
  - USE forensic fields for genuine design decision discoveries only
  - CONNECT project structure to business purpose and technical requirements

  üìã Return optimized JSON with focused codebase insights.
