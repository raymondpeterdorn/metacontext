  üîç CONDUCT MEDIA FORENSICS INVESTIGATION:

  üé¨ MEDIA EVIDENCE:
  - File: ${file_name}
  - Media Type: ${media_type}
  - File Size: ${file_size}
  - Dimensions: ${dimensions}
  - Duration: ${duration}
  - Format: ${format}
  - Creation Date: ${creation_date}
  - Technical Metadata: ${technical_metadata}
  - Project Context: ${project_summary}

  ‚öôÔ∏è Schema Reference (summary only):
  ${schema_hint}

  üîç MEDIA FORENSICS PROTOCOL:
  
  1. **PRODUCTION WORKFLOW**: What creation and processing tools produced this media?
  2. **QUALITY/COMPRESSION**: What do quality and compression choices reveal about usage intent?
  3. **CREATION CONTEXT**: What context is embedded in metadata and technical specifications?
  4. **CONTENT PURPOSE**: What delivery requirements guided format and technical choices?
  5. **MEDIA WORKFLOW**: What processing pipeline is evident from encoding parameters?

  üéØ EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS:
  - Maximum response: 1000 characters total
  - Per field limit: 180 characters
  - Use precise media terminology
  - Focus on most revealing technical insights

  ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL Output Format Rules:
  - suspicious_patterns: Must be a list ["pattern1", "pattern2"] or null
  - cross_references: Must be a dict {"element": "explanation"} or null
  - Never include markdown or prose ‚Äî output must be **valid JSON only**
  - Focus on production workflow and technical decisions
  - Skip commentary about the task or user

  üìã Example Output Structure:
  {
    "ai_interpretation": "Media production context and technical purpose",
    "ai_confidence": "HIGH",
    "ai_domain_context": "Media production domain and delivery context",
    "usage_guidance": "How this media should be used and processed",
    "hidden_meaning": "Production decisions or workflow requirements embedded in media",
    "suspicious_patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"],
    "cross_references": {"element": "explanation"},
    "detective_insights": "Key insights about production workflow and technical choices"
  }

  üìã Return optimized JSON with focused media insights.
