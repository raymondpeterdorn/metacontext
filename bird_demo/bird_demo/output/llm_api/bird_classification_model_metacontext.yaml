    ai_interpretation: This model is a scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier designed
      for bird species classification.
    ai_confidence: HIGH
    ai_domain_context: 'Bird Classification: Identifies bird species based on input
      features, likely for ecological monitoring or citizen science.'
    usage_guidance: Automated bird species identification; ecological surveys; educational
      applications for bird recognition.
    hidden_meaning: The provided 'training script' is a test framework for metacontext
      comparison, not the actual training code for this bird classification model.
    suspicious_patterns:
    - The listed 'training script' is a test framework, not the model's actual training
      code.
    - Model version is null, indicating potential lack of version control.

    detective_insights: ''
    model_type_analysis: Scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier. Ensemble of 10 decision
      trees, uses Gini impurity criterion, `max_features='sqrt'`, bootstrap sampling.
    purpose: To classify bird species into one of 5 categories based on 3 input features,
      supporting automated identification tasks.
    training_approach: Ensemble learning using bootstrap aggregation (bagging) with
      10 decision trees. Each tree is trained on a random subset of features and samples.
    expected_inputs: A 1D array or list of 3 numerical features, representing distinct
      characteristics of a bird (e.g., measurements, spectral data).
    expected_outputs: A classification prediction, likely an integer from 0-4 representing
      one of 5 bird species classes, or probability distribution over classes.
    limitations: Model relies on only 3 features, potentially limiting accuracy. Small
      `n_estimators=10` may lead to underfitting. No explicit versioning.
