  ai_enrichment:
    ai_interpretation: This model is a scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier designed
      for bird species classification based on limited observational features.
    ai_confidence: HIGH
    ai_domain_context: 'Ecology/Biology: Bird species identification, likely for environmental
      monitoring or biodiversity studies.'
    usage_guidance: Predict bird species from environmental observations. Useful for
      ecological surveys or automated wildlife monitoring.
    hidden_meaning: The small `n_estimators=10` suggests a focus on computational
      efficiency or smaller datasets, potentially sacrificing some accuracy.
    suspicious_patterns:
    - '`model_version` and `output_classes` are null, hindering traceability. Mismatch:
      `input_feature_count` (3) vs. `training_features` (2).'
    cross_references: {}
    model_type_analysis: Scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier, an ensemble of 10 decision
      trees. Uses Gini impurity for splits and 'sqrt' max_features.
    purpose: To accurately classify bird species (`species_name`) using limited input
      features like observation month and location type.
    training_approach: Ensemble learning via Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging) with
      10 decision trees. Splits use Gini criterion, `random_state=42`.
    expected_inputs: '3 numerical features in a 1D array. Two identified: ''observation_month''
      (int/float) and ''location_type'' (categorical/encoded).'
    expected_outputs: A prediction for one of 5 possible output classes, representing
      the `species_name`. Likely a class label or probability distribution.
    limitations: Low `n_estimators` (10) may limit robustness. Only 3 input features
      could lead to underfitting. Missing explicit output class labels.
