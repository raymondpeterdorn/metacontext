      color_space: RGB
  ai_enrichment:
    ai_interpretation: This is a very small, low-resolution RGB TIFF image, likely
      a placeholder or test asset for geospatial applications, possibly depicting
      a bird.
    ai_confidence: HIGH
    ai_domain_context: 'Geospatial Imaging: Raster data, 20x20 pixel dimensions, RGB
      color space, typically used for mapping or environmental data.'
    usage_guidance: Use for unit testing geospatial raster loading/processing. Suitable
      as a minimal example for API documentation.
    hidden_meaning: The 'bird' in the filename suggests it's a specific, identifiable
      test case, possibly for object detection or classification within a geospatial
      context, despite its low resolution.
    suspicious_patterns:
    - Extremely low resolution (20x20) for practical geospatial analysis.
    - Very small file size (1.3KB) indicates minimal data content.
    cross_references:
      file_name: geospatial_raster_bird.tif -> Implies a bird image within a geospatial
        raster format, likely for testing specific data types.
    content_description: A 20x20 pixel RGB image, likely a highly pixelated representation
      of a bird, formatted as a geospatial raster.
    quality_assessment: Visual quality is extremely poor due to 20x20 resolution,
      rendering it unsuitable for detailed interpretation. Technical integrity as
      a TIFF is likely sound.
    technical_analysis: TIFF format, 20x20 pixels, 3 channels (RGB), 1340 bytes. Likely
      uncompressed or uses lossless compression given the small size and common TIFF
      usage.
    use_case_recommendations:
    - Testing geospatial image processing pipelines.
    - Demonstrating basic raster data handling.
    - Placeholder for UI elements requiring a raster image.
    applications:
    - Geospatial software development
    - Image processing libraries
    - Data visualization prototyping
