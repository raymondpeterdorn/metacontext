  ai_enrichment:
    ai_interpretation: This model is a scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier designed
      to classify bird species based on limited observational features.
    ai_confidence: HIGH
    ai_domain_context: 'Ecology/Ornithology: Classifies bird species using observational
      data like month and location type.'
    usage_guidance: Use for automated bird species identification in ecological monitoring
      or citizen science projects.
    hidden_meaning: Low `n_estimators` (10) suggests a quick, potentially less robust
      model. `random_state=42` ensures reproducibility.
    suspicious_patterns:
    - '`n_estimators=10` is very low for RandomForest, risking underfitting and high
      variance.'
    - Model version is null, hindering traceability.
    cross_references: {}
    model_type_analysis: Scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier, an ensemble of 10 decision
      trees using Gini impurity and 'sqrt' max_features.
    purpose: To accurately classify the `species_name` of birds based on environmental
      and temporal observation data.
    training_approach: Ensemble learning via bootstrap aggregation (bagging) of 10
      decision trees, each trained on a bootstrapped sample.
    expected_inputs: A 3-feature vector, including `observation_month`, `location_type`,
      and one unnamed feature, for classification.
    expected_outputs: A prediction of one of 5 `species_name` classes, typically as
      a class label or probability distribution over classes.
    limitations: Low `n_estimators` (10) risks underfitting. Limited named input features
      (2 of 3) restrict predictive power.
