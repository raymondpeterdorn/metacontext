  ai_enrichment:
    ai_interpretation: This model is a scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier designed
      for multi-class classification, likely for bird species identification.
    ai_confidence: HIGH
    ai_domain_context: 'Bird Classification: Identifies bird species based on input
      features, likely biological measurements.'
    usage_guidance: Use for automated bird species identification in ecological surveys
      or citizen science applications.
    hidden_meaning: The provided "training script" is a test framework for metacontext
      comparison, not the actual model training code, indicating missing core context.
    suspicious_patterns:
    - The actual training script for the model is missing; `test_comparison_framework.py`
      is a testing utility.
    - '`n_estimators=10` is very low for RandomForest, potentially leading to underfitting.'

      MetacontextComparator: bird_demo/output/metacontext_comparison/compare_metacontexts.py
    model_type_analysis: Scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier, an ensemble of 10 decision
      trees. Uses Gini impurity criterion, bootstrap sampling, and `sqrt` max_features.
    purpose: To classify input data into one of five distinct categories, most likely
      identifying different bird species.
    training_approach: Ensemble learning using 10 decision trees. Each tree is trained
      on bootstrapped samples, with feature subsets (`max_features='sqrt'`) and Gini
      criterion.
    expected_inputs: A numerical array of shape `[3]`, representing three distinct
      features for classification.
    expected_outputs: A numerical array of shape `[5]`, likely representing probability
      scores or one-hot encoded predictions for 5 classes.
    limitations: Low `n_estimators` (10) may lead to underfitting and reduced robustness.
      Only 3 input features might limit model discriminative power.
    ideal_use_cases: Rapid, initial classification of bird species where input features
      are limited to three key measurements.
    data_requirements: Requires structured numerical data with 3 features per sample,
      corresponding to 5 distinct target classes.
