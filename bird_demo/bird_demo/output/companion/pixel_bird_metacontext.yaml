      dimensions:
      - 20
      - 20
      color_space: RGB
  ai_enrichment:
    ai_interpretation: 20×20 RGB pixel-art bird sprite, optimized as a compact demo/UI
      asset.
    ai_confidence: HIGH
    ai_domain_context: Iconography; pixel-art thumbnails characterized by low resolution,
      limited palette, and sprite usage.
    usage_guidance: Use as UI thumbnail or sprite; preserve edges with nearest-neighbor
      scaling to avoid blur.
    hidden_meaning: Programmatic demo/companion export optimized for minimal bytes
      and legibility rather than photographic fidelity.
    suspicious_patterns:
    - extremely low resolution (20×20)
    - very small file size (146 bytes) implies palette reduction or stripped metadata
    - limited color palette causing banding/blockiness
    cross_references:
      pixel_bird.png: bird_demo/output/companion/pixel_bird.png
    detective_insights: Produced by demo pipeline for compact delivery; intended as
      exemplar/thumbnail, not raw photographic data.
    content_description: Single flat-colored bird sprite with no photographic detail.
    quality_assessment: Technically intact PNG but severely pixelated when scaled;
      minimal metadata; unsuitable for fine-grained image analysis.
    technical_analysis: PNG raster, 20×20 px, RGB; 146 B suggests palette-optimized
      (likely PNG8) or aggressive compression; no audio stream.
    use_case_recommendations:
    - UI/iconography
    - low-bandwidth demos
    - retro-style game sprite
    applications:
    - mobile/web UI
    - tutorials and demos
    - pixel-art games
    processing_recommendations: 'For larger use: nearest-neighbor upscaling, optional
      PNG8 repalette, and embed provenance metadata; retain original for fidelity.'
